# Python Programs and Concepts

Welcome to the **Python Programs and Concepts** repository! 🚀  
This repository contains a wide collection of Python programs, code examples, and key programming concepts. It is designed as a learning resource for beginners, intermediates, and anyone who wants to strengthen their Python skills.

## 📚 What's Inside

- **Basic Programs:**  
  Simple Python scripts to cover foundational programming concepts (loops, conditionals, functions, etc.)

- **Data Structures and Algorithms:**  
  Implementations of important data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs) and common algorithms (searching, sorting, recursion, dynamic programming).

- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming):**  
  Examples demonstrating classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and more.

- **Advanced Python Concepts:**  
  Topics like decorators, generators, context managers, multithreading, and file handling.

- **Mini Projects:**  
  Small, hands-on projects to put concepts into practice.

- **Notes and Explanations:**  
  Short notes and code comments explaining the 'why' behind the 'how'.
